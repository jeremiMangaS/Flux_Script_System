FLUX SCRIPT ENGINE

Flux Script System is a simple system that combines the architecture of the C++ language with Lua in building a system that can be run and changed directly without the need to shut down or 
restart the program first. Where C++ will be the main engine and Lua will be the logic that will manage the system through the C++ engine, so there is no need to rerun the program to 
immediately see light results. (For heavy things like changing the engine logic, it still has to be done through the C++ program directly so it still needs to be rerun the program).
